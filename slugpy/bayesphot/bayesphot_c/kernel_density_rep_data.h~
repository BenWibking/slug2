/* This is just a data file that holds a tabulated function used by
   the kernel_density_rep_code. The function stored is the logarithm
   of the normalized maximum error that results from approximating a
   pair of Gaussians of equal dispersion with relative weights w and
   (1-w) and peaks separated by a distance dx (measured in units of
   the dispersion) and approximating them by a single Gaussian with
   the same mean and variance. The error is defined as the maximum
   of the absolute value of the difference between the single and
   double Gaussians over all points x, normalized to the maximum of
   the single Gaussian approximation.

   This table was generated by MRK using mathematica on 8/10/15.
