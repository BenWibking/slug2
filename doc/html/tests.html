<p>This section describes a set of problems that can be used to test and explore the different capabilities of SLUG. SLUG ships a
set of problems <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">problemname</span></tt> that are specified by a parameter file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">param/problemname.param</span></tt>. Problems that require
multiple simulations are described instead by multiple paramater files, each with unique ID XX:  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">param/problemnameXX.param</span></tt>.
Users can reproduce the output of the test problems with the provided executable scripts  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/run_problemname.sh</span></tt>.
For each problem, a script for analysis is distributed  in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/problemname.py</span></tt>. Details for each test problem are given below.
Throughout this section, it is assumed that the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SLUG_DIR</span></tt> has been properly set.</p>

<h2>Problem <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">example</span></tt>: basic galaxy simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-example-basic-galaxy-simulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This problem illustrates the basic usage of slugin <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">galaxy</span></tt> mode by running 48 realizations of a galaxy with constant
<span class="math">\(\mathrm{SFR}=0.001\; M_\odot\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\)</span>, up to a maximum time of <span class="math">\(2\times 10^8\)</span> yr. By issuing the
command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/run_example.sh</span></tt> the output files <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SLUG_EXAMPLE*</span></tt> are generated. Once the models are ready,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">test/plot_example.py</span></tt> produces a multi-panel figure <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/SLUG_EXAMPLE_f1.pdf</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The top-left panel shows the actual mass produced by SLUG for each of the 48 models at different time steps as a
function of the targeted mass. One can see that SLUG realizations only approximate the desired mass, which is a consequence
of SLUG core algorithm. The 1:1 relation is shown by a red dashed line.
The remaining panels show examples of integrated photometry (as labeled) of all simulated galaxies
at different time steps, as a function of the actual mass. Due to its stochastic nature, SLUG produces
distributions rather than single values for each time step. The expected rate of ionizing
photon and the bolometric luminosities for a deterministic model with a
continuous star formation rate of <span class="math">\(\mathrm{SFR}=0.001\; M_\odot\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\)</span> are shown
by red dashed lines in the relevant panels.</p>

<h2>Problem <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">example_cluster</span></tt>: basic cluster simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-example-cluster-basic-cluster-simulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This problem illustrates the basic usage of SLUG in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cluster</span></tt> mode by running 1000 realizations of a cluster
with mass 500 <span class="math">\(M_\odot\)</span>, up to a maximum time of 10 Myr. By issuing the command
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/run_example_cluster.sh</span></tt> the output files <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SLUG_CLUSTER_EXAMPLE*</span></tt> are
generated. Once the models are ready, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">test/plot_example_cluster.py</span></tt> produces a multi-panel
figure <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/SLUG_CLUSTER_EXAMPLE_f1.pdf</span></tt>.</p>
<p>This figure is divided in two columns: the left one shows outputs at the first time step, 1 Myr, while
the second one shows outputs at the last time step, 10 Myr.  The top row shows the actual cluster mass for an
input mass of <span class="math">\(500\;M_\odot\)</span>.
In <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cluster</span></tt> mode, all clusters are generated at the first time step and they evolve
passively after that. Thus, the mass does not change. As a consequence of the
random drawing from the IMF, masses are distributed around the input mass.
As the wanted mass is large enough to allow for many stars to be drawn, the
actual mass distribution is narrow.</p>
<p>The second row shows instead the distribution of the maximum mass of all stars that are still
alive at a given time step. At 1 Myr, this distribution is a good approximation of the
input distribution, which is the result of random draws from the IMF. At 10 Myr, which is the
typical lifetime of a 15-20 <span class="math">\(M_\odot\)</span> star, the most massive stars have died, and
SLUG stops following them. The distribution of luminosities, and particularly those
most sensitive to the presence of massive stars, change accordingly
(third and fourth row for <span class="math">\(Q_{H_0}\)</span> and FUV).</p>

<div class="section" id="problem-constsampl-importance-of-constrained-sampling">
<span id="probsampl-label"></span><h2>Problem <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">constsampl</span></tt>: importance of constrained sampling<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-constsampl-importance-of-constrained-sampling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This problem illustrates in more detail the effects of constrained sampling on SLUG simulations.
This is the first key ingredient in the core algorithm of SLUG. With the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/run_constsampl.sh</span></tt>,
three different <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cluster</span></tt> simulations are run, each with 1000 trials, but with masses of <span class="math">\(50\;M_\odot\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(250\;M_\odot\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(500\;M_\odot\)</span>. A single timestep of <span class="math">\(10^6\)</span> yr is generated.
The analysis script <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">test/plot_constsampl.py</span></tt> produces a multi-panel
figure <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/SLUG_CONSTSAMPL_f1.pdf</span></tt>.</p>
<p>This figure shows the maximum mass of the stars in these realizations (top row), the
rate of ionizing photons <span class="math">\(Q_{H_0}\)</span> (central row), and the FUV luminosity (bottom row).
Histograms refer, form left to right, to clusters with <span class="math">\(50\;M_\odot\)</span>, <span class="math">\(250\;M_\odot\)</span>,
and <span class="math">\(500\;M_\odot\)</span>.</p>
<p>Due to the small timestep, the distributions of stellar masses shown in the top panels reflect
to good approximation the distribution of the maximum stellar masses that are drawn from the IMF by
SLUG in each realization. For a cluster of <span class="math">\(50\;M_\odot\)</span>, the vast majority of the
stars are drawn below  <span class="math">\(20-50\;M_\odot\)</span>. This is an obvious consequence of the
fact that a cluster cannot contain stars much more massive than its own mass. However, stars
more massive then the targeted mass are not impossible realizations for the default
sampling algorithm (see below). For instance, if the first star to be drawn has
mass <span class="math">\(60\;M_\odot\)</span>, then SLUG would add it to the cluster and stop. Leaving this star out
would indeed be a worse approximation than overshooting the targeted cluster mass by only
<span class="math">\(10\;M_\odot\)</span>.  From left to right, one can see that, as the targeted cluster mass increases, the
histogram shifts to progressively higher masses. In the limit of an infinite cluster,
all stellar masses would be represented, and the histogram would peak at <span class="math">\(120\;M_\odot\)</span>.
Essentially, this constrained sampling introduces a stochastic (and not deterministic)
variation in the IMF. An IMF truncated above <span class="math">\(60\;M_\odot\)</span> would roughly
approximate the results of the left column; however, a deterministic cut-off
would not correctly reproduce the non-zero tail at higher masses, thus artificially
reducing the scatter introduced by random sampling.</p>
<p>The second and third row simply reflect what said above: for large clusters that can host
stars at all masses, the luminosity peaks around what is expected according to a deterministic
stellar population synthesis codes. At lower cluster masses, ionizing and UV fluxes
are instead suppresses, due to the lack of massive stars. However, tails to high values exist
in all cases.</p>

<h2>Problem <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sampling</span></tt>: different sampling techniques<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-sampling-different-sampling-techniques" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As highlighted in the previous section, the method with which stars are sampled from the
IMF has a great influence on the final output. Starting from v2, SLUG has the capability of
specifying the desired sampling algorithm for a given PDF.
The command  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/run_sampling.sh</span></tt> runs four <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cluster</span></tt> simulations, each with 1000 trials
of masses of <span class="math">\(50\;M_\odot\)</span>, and a Kroupa (2002) IMF.
The following four sampling methods are chosen for each simulation: 1) <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stop_nearest</span></tt>,
which is the default in SLUG; 2) <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stop_before</span></tt>; 3) <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stop_after</span></tt>; 4) <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sorted_sampling</span></tt>.
A description of each method is provided in Section <a class="reference internal" href="pdfs.html#sampling-metod-label"><em>Sampling Methods</em></a>.
The analysis script <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">test/plot_sampling.py</span></tt> produces a multi-panel
figure <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/SLUG_SAMPLING_f1.pdf</span></tt>.</p>
<p>By comparing the panels in each column, one can understand the fundamental differences
induced by the sampling technique. The top row shows the maximum stellar mass drawn from the
IMF in each realization. The targeted cluster mass is also shown with red vertical lines.
In the default mode, SLUG is allowed to overshoot the targeted mass if that constitutes
a good approximation for the total cluster mass. Thus, a tail at stellar masses above the
targeted cluster mass is visible. This tail is accentuated when the stop after method
is selected (third column). In this case, SLUG always overshoots the cluster mass, and thus
extreme realizations above <span class="math">\(100\;M_\odot\)</span>  are possible. Conversely, in the
stop after method (second column), SLUG always under-fills the clusters, and (in this case)
the cluster mass becomes a limit to the maximum stellar mass that can be drawn. A similar effect
is seen when sorted sampling is enable (fourth column). However, the correspondence between the
cluster mass and the maximum stellar mass is not trivially established, as it depends on the
shape of the IMF. The second and third row show how the sampling techniques affect the output
photometry.</p>

<div class="section" id="problem-imfchoice-different-imf-implementations">
<span id="probimf-label"></span><h2>Problem <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">imfchoice</span></tt>: different IMF implementations<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-imfchoice-different-imf-implementations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This problem highlights how SLUG can handle different IMF implementations by running
three simulations with a Kroupa, a Salpeter, and a Chabrier IMF. However, SLUG is not
restricted to these choices, as the user can in fact easily input an arbitrary IMF.
The command  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/run_imfchoice.sh</span></tt> runs three <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cluster</span></tt> simulations, each with 1000 trials
of masses of <span class="math">\(500\;M_\odot\)</span> and different IMF. The analysis script
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">test/plot_imfchoice.py</span></tt> produces a multi-panel figure <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/SLUG_IMFCHOICE_f1.pdf</span></tt>.
Each column shows different statistics for the three IMF. From top to bottom, these are:
the maximum stellar mass in a cluster, the number of stars that SLUG treats stochastically,
and the distributions of <span class="math">\(Q_{H_0}\)</span>  and bolometric luminosities.
As expected for a steep lower-end of the IMF, in the Salpeter case SLUG prefers to fill the
clusters with a higher number of low mass stars.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="problem-clfraction-cluster-fraction-at-work">
<h2>Problem <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">clfraction</span></tt>: cluster fraction at work<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-clfraction-cluster-fraction-at-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With the exception of the first example, these test problems have focused on how SLUG handles
cluster simulations, and how these clusters are filled with stars drawn from the IMF.
This new problem highlights instead the presence of additional stochasticity induced by a
second level in the hierarchy of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">galaxy</span></tt> simulations: how clusters are drawn from the CMF to satisfy the
targeted galaxy mass. Although it may not appear obvious at first,
the fraction of stars that are formed in clusters, <span class="math">\(f_c\)</span>, is a very important parameter that regulates
the stochastic behavior of SLUG. This can be understood by considering two limiting cases.
In the limit <span class="math">\(f_c \rightarrow 0\)</span>, SLUG fills a galaxy by drawing stars from the
IMF. Thus, because the mass of a galaxy is typically much larger than the mass of the upper
end of the IMF, the effects of mass-constrained sampling highlighted in <a class="reference internal" href="#probsampl-label"><em>Problem constsampl: importance of constrained sampling</em></a> are simply
not relevant anymore. In this case, stochasticity is minimal.
Conversely, in the limit <span class="math">\(f_c \rightarrow 1\)</span>, not only the IMF sampling contributes to the
stochastic behavior of SLUG, but also clusters themselves contribute to additional stochasticity,
as clusters are now drawn from the CMF to fill the targeted galaxy mass following the similar rules
to those specified for the IMF draws. Thus, in this case, constrained mass sampling applies to both
stars in clusters and clusters in galaxies, and stochasticity is amplified.</p>
<p>The command  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/run_clfraction.sh</span></tt> runs three <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">galaxy</span></tt> simulations, each with 500 trials
of continuous  SFR <span class="math">\(=0.001\rm\;M_\odot\;yr^{-1}\)</span> which are evolved for a
single timestep of  <span class="math">\(2\times 10^6\rm\;yr\)</span>. A Chabrier IMF and a cluster mass function
<span class="math">\(\propto M^{-2}\)</span> are adopted. Cluster disruption is disabled. The three simulations
differ only for the fraction of stars formed in clusters, respectively <span class="math">\(f_c=1,0.5,0.01\)</span>.
The analysis script <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">test/plot_clfraction.py</span></tt> produces a multi-panel figure
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/SLUG_CLFRACTION_f1.pdf</span></tt>. Each column shows properties of simulations for different
fractions of stars formed in clusters.</p>
<p>The top row shows the maximum stellar mass in clusters. Clearly, <span class="math">\(f_c\)</span> has no effect on the way
clusters are filled up with stars, but the normalization changes. Thus,  the least probable realizations
in the tail of the distribution simply do not appear for <span class="math">\(f_c \rightarrow 0\)</span>. The second row
shows the number of stars in clusters. Obviously, this scales directly with  <span class="math">\(f_c\)</span>, as it does the number
of field stars in the third row. This is expected as, by definition, <span class="math">\(f_c\)</span> regulates the number of stars in
clusters versus the field. However, as discussed, <span class="math">\(f_c\)</span> also affects the stochastic behavior of the
simulation. The fourth row shows histograms of the actual galaxy mass versus the targeted mass (red line).
As <span class="math">\(f_c\)</span> increases, one can see that the spread around the targeted mass increase. This is again
a consequence of the mass-constrained sampling and the stop-nearest condition. For <span class="math">\(f_c \rightarrow 0\)</span>,
the code tries to fill a galaxy of mass <span class="math">\(0.001\rm\;M_\odot\;yr^{-1} \times 2\times 10^6\rm\;yr\)</span>
with stars. Thus, since the targeted mass is at least a factor of 10 larger than the mass of the
building block, SLUG can approximate the desired mass very well (to better than <span class="math">\(120\rm\;M_\odot\)</span>, in fact).
Conversely, for <span class="math">\(f_c \rightarrow 1\)</span>, SLUG is using clusters as building blocks. As the typical
mass of the building blocks is now more comparable to the targeted galaxy mass, the problem of the
mass constrained sampling becomes a relevant one. Not only <span class="math">\(f_c\)</span> affects the precision with which
SLUG builds galaxies, but, as shown in the bottom row, it also affects photometry. One can see that
<span class="math">\(Q_{H_0}\)</span> increases as <span class="math">\(f_c\)</span> decreases (the red lines indicate medians).
The reason for this behavior should now be clear:
in the case of clustered star formation (<span class="math">\(f_c \rightarrow 1\)</span>), the mass of the most massive stars
is subject to the mass constrained sampling of the IMF at the cluster level, reducing the occurrence of
very massive stars and thus suppressing the flux of ionizing radiation. Conversely, for non clustered star formation
(<span class="math">\(f_c \rightarrow 0\)</span>), the sampling of the IMF is constrained only at the galaxy mass level, and since this
is typically much greater than the mass of the most massive stars, one recovers higher fluxes on average.</p>

<h2>Problem <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cmfchoice</span></tt>: different CMF implementations<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-cmfchoice-different-cmf-implementations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Given the ability of SLUG v2 to handle generic PDFs, the user can specify arbitrary CMF,
similarly to what shown in  <a class="reference internal" href="#probimf-label"><em>Problem imfchoice: different IMF implementations</em></a>.
The command  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/run_cmfchoice.sh</span></tt> runs three <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">galaxy</span></tt> simulations, each with 500 trials
of continuous  SFR <span class="math">\(=0.001\rm\;M_\odot\;yr^{-1}\)</span> which are evolved for a
single timestep of  <span class="math">\(2\times 10^6\rm\;yr\)</span>. A Chabrier IMF and <span class="math">\(f_c=1\)</span>
are adopted. Cluster disruption is disabled. The three simulations
differ only for the cluster mass function, which are:
1) the default powerlaw <span class="math">\(M^{-2}\)</span> between <span class="math">\(20-10^{7}~\rm M_\odot\)</span>;
2) a truncated powerlaw <span class="math">\(M^{-2}\)</span> between <span class="math">\(20-100~\rm M_\odot\)</span>;
3) a mass-independent CMF <span class="math">\(M^{0}\)</span> between <span class="math">\(20-10^3~\rm M_\odot\)</span>.
The analysis script <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">test/plot_cmfchoice.py</span></tt> produces a multi-panel figure
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/SLUG_CMFCHOICE_f1.pdf</span></tt>. Each column shows properties of simulations for the different
cluster mass functions.</p>
<p>The top row shows the maximum stellar mass in clusters. Compared to the default case,
the histogram of the truncated CMF is steeper towards low masses. Given that the upper end of the
CMF is comparable to the maximum stellar mass of the chosen IMF, low stellar masses are typically
preferred  as a result of the stop-nearest condition. A flat CMF
prefers instead more massive clusters on average, which in turn results in higher probabilities
of drawing massive stars. In this case, the residual slope of the distribution towards
low stellar masses is a result of the shape of the IMF. A reflection of the effects induced by the
shape of the CMF are also apparent in the bottom row, which shows the distribution of
ionizing photons from these simulations. The second row shows instead the difference
between the targeted galaxy mass (red line), and the distribution of actual masses.
The spread is minimal for the truncated CMF because, as discussed above, SLUG is using
small building blocks, and it can approximate the targeted galaxy mass very well.
Larger spread is visible in the case of the flat CMF, as this choice allows for clusters with masses
up to <span class="math">\(10^3~\rm M_\odot\)</span>, without imposing an excess of probability at the low
mass end. The largest scatter is visible for the default case, as this CMF is virtually
a pure powerlaw without cutoff at the high mass end, and thus clusters as massive as the entire galaxy
are accessible to SLUG.</p>

<div class="section" id="problem-sfhsampling-realizations-of-sfh">
<h2>Problem <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sfhsampling</span></tt>: realizations of SFH<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-sfhsampling-realizations-of-sfh" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The algorithm at the heart of SLUG is quite simple: for a given star formation history
<span class="math">\(\dot\psi(t)\)</span> a stellar population with mass <span class="math">\(\dot\psi(t)\times \Delta t\)</span>
is generated at each timestep, according to the constraints set by IMF, CMF and other
controlling parameters. As discussed in the previous examples, SLUG builds a best
approximation for the targeted mass <span class="math">\(\dot\psi(t)\times \Delta t\)</span>. This means that
the input SFH and the output SFHs are not identical. SLUG receives an input SFH which
is used to constrain the rate with which clusters and stars are drawn to achieve the
desired targeted mass in each timestep. However, the output SFHs are only realizations
and not exact copies  of the input SFH. This problem is designed to illustrate this behavior.</p>
<p>The command  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/run_sfhsampling.sh</span></tt> runs two <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">galaxy</span></tt> simulations, each with 100 trials
of continuous  SFR <span class="math">\(=0.0001\rm\;M_\odot\;yr^{-1}\)</span> which are evolved for a
10 timesteps of  <span class="math">\(5\times 10^6\rm\;yr\)</span>. A Chabrier IMF and a <span class="math">\(M^{-2}\)</span>
CMF are adopted. Cluster disruption is disabled. The two simulations
differ only for the fraction of stars in clusters, <span class="math">\(f_c = 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f_c = 0\)</span> respectively.
The analysis script <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">test/plot_sfhsampling.py</span></tt> produces a two-panel figure
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test/SLUG_SFHSAMPLING_f1.pdf</span></tt>, showing the box plot for the output SFH of the two simulations
(<span class="math">\(f_c = 1\)</span> top, and <span class="math">\(f_c = 0\)</span> bottom).</p>
<p>In each panel, the median SFH over 100 trials is represented by the red lines, while the red squares
show the mean. The box sizes represent instead the first and third quartile, with the
ends of the whiskers representing the 5th and 95th percentiles. One can see that the input
SFH at <span class="math">\(\dot\psi(t)=10^{-4}\rm\;M_\odot\;yr^{-1}\)</span> is recovered on average, albeit with
significant variation in each realization. The reason for this variation lies in the fact that,
at low SFRs, SLUG samples the input SFH with coarse sampling points, which are clusters and stars.
One can also notice a widely different scatter between the <span class="math">\(f_c = 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f_c = 0\)</span>
case. In the former case, the basic elements used by SLUG to sample the targeted mass in  a
given interval are clusters. In the latter case, they are stars. Given that the typical mass of a
cluster is of the same order of the targeted mass in each interval, the output SFH for
the <span class="math">\(f_c = 1\)</span> case are more sensitive to the history of drawings from the CMF.
Conversely, for  <span class="math">\(f_c = 0\)</span>, the sampling elements are less massive than the
targeted mass in a given interval, resulting in an output SFH distribution which is
better converged towards the input value. Clearly, a comparable amplitude in the scatter
will be present in the output photometry, especially for the traces that are more sensitive
to variations in the SFHs on short timescales.</p>
