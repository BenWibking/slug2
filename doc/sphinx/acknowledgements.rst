SLUG was made possible by contributions from a number of people. The original SLUG v1 code was written by Robert da Silva and Michele Fumagalli. This reimplementation was primarily written by Mark Krumholz and Michele Fumagalli, with contributions from Jonathan Parra. The slugpy library was written by Mark Krumholz, with contributions from Teddy Rendahl (who wrote the first version of cloudy_slug) and Robert da Silva (who wrote the first version of sfr_slug). In addition to these contributors, several other people provided some of the data on which SLUG relies.
