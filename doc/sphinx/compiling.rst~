Compiling and Installing SLUG
=============================

Dependencies
------------

The core SLUG program requires

* The `Boost C++ libraries <http://www.boost.org/>`_
* The `GNU scientific library <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_
* The `cfitsio library <http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html>`_ (optional, only required for FITS capabilities)

Compilation will be easiest if you install these libraries such that the header files are included in your ``CXX_INCLUDE_PATH`` and the compiled object files are in your ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``. Alternately, you can manually specify the locations of these files by editing the Makefiles -- see below. The cfitsio library is optional, and is only required if you want the ability to write FITS output. To compile without it, use the flag ``FITS=DISABLE_FITS`` when calling ``make`` (see below). Note that SLUG uses some Boost libraries that must be built separately (see the Boost documentation on how to build and install Boost libraries).

In addition to the core dependencies, slugpy, the python helper library requires:

* `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
* `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
* `astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`_ (optional, only required for FITS capabilities)
